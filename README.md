# League-of-Legends-Data-Collection

This script was created as I wanted to analysis League of Legends players skills, ranks and information. I also had never scraped a website before and so I wanted to gain experience with this.

I scraped from a website called op.gg which is a very well known league of legends website that updates with rankings and game information for all players. I wouldn't recommend running this script as I feel that op.gg wouldnt appreciate the hit's they'd get from a bot gathering all their information and I was surprised that I wasn't ip banned or anything. The information once collected was saved to an excel file.

Install the required Python libraries by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the Python directory.
